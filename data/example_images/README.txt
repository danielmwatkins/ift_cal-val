Example Images
---------------
These images provide examples of poor segmentation: obvious over/under segmentation, and poor representation of floe boundaries. 

psd_files: Photoshop files with a layer created for each segmentation result
good_segmentation: Labeled floe png files from the validation data
oversegmentation: Objects broken into too many pieces
